This is a cli tool that has the 
idea of a linked list but
it workd with commands!!

the commands are:
    add
    del
    count 
    print
    cls
    exit
    help

the "add" command is for adding nodes
to the the linked list :
    you just saying. syntax: add [value] 
    and adds it to the list. 
    LIST: value -> NULL

the "del" command is for deleteing 
node from the linked list :
    you also passing values here
    syntax: del [value] 
    after that the value no longer exist
    int the list

the "count" command count the 
Nodes so if you just type count:
    it show you how many nodes
    the list has.
    USE: count 
    OUTPUT: Elements count: 4

the "print" command prints the 
list so if you jus type 'print'
    the ouput will be something
    like that:
    4 -> 2 -> 8 -> NULL

the "cls" command clears the 
terminal screen so if your
screen is filled with text:
    type 'cls' and it clears 
    it !!

the "exit" command is for exiting 
the program when you want:
    just type 'exit' and
    the program will stop

the "help" command is for 
showing you all the evailble
commands. it explains them 
sortly and works like a cheetseet
